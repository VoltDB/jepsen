> ACID transactions in VoltDB offer guarantees that changes to a database
> record are made, that data is correct, and that no data is lost.

> VoltDB offers serializable isolation.

> Where failures force a choice between consistency and availability, VoltDB
> chooses consistency.

> Because VoltDB always performs synchronous replication of read-write
> transactions within a partition, end-users are guaranteed to read the results
> of prior writes even when reads bypass the SPI sequencer.

> Each of the described components - partitions, SPIs, and the MPI - can fail as
> part of a node failure or network partition. Faults are detected and new
> cluster topologies are established via a distributed agreement protocol. New
> topology states are updated in an embedded version of ZooKeeper that runs as
> part of each VoltDB cluster. The transaction management system uses standard
> ZooKeeper leader election techniques to elect new SPIs and a new MPI to
> replace any failed components.

> Where failures force a choice between (CAP-wise) consistency and
> availability, VoltDB chooses consistency.
